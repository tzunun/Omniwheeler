Wheel Movement
    from observation there are only three whell spining states which dictate the direction that
    the robot moves.
        ACW = Anti-clockwise
        CW = Clockwise
        Still = No movement.

Four Wheels
    These are controlled by GPIO indicating motor state (on/off) and rotation
    ACW/CW.

    Wheel 1:
        Motor: ON/OFF 
            GPIO 7
        Rotation: ACW/CW
            GPIO 11

    Wheel 2:
        Motor: ON/OFF 
            GPIO 13
        Rotation: ACW/CW
            GPIO 15

    Wheel 3:
        Motor: ON/OFF 
            GPIO 19
        Rotation: ACW/CW
            GPIO 21
        
    Wheel 4:
        Motor: ON/OFF 
            GPIO 23
        Rotation: ACW/CW
            GPIO 29

Direction of Movement (Robot)
    There are at the moment 11 possible directions of movement for the robot.
    these can be achieved with 6 functions
    
    Original:   North   East    North-East  North-West  Clockwise       Full-Stop
    Inverted:   South   West    South-West  South-East  Anti-Clockwise    N/A

Regarding the GPIO controls
    I have started thinking about using gpiozero for the control

and I have also started thinking about using docker to run the robot

instructions on how to install python3 and the environment required
to run this application.
